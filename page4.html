    <p>On your special day, I pray that all your dreams come true and that happiness follows you wherever you go. Even though we're apart right now, my thoughts and heart are always with you. I am so grateful to have you in my life, and I can't wait to share every moment with you. Wishing you a day full of joy, peace, and all the beautiful things life has to offer.</p>
